== The Dice Evaluator

Dice https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infix_notation[infix notation] (aka calculator notation) expression evaluator, using the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting_yard_algorithm[shunting yard algorithm].
The dice can have numbers or text/symbols on them.
Some operators work only on numbers.
It is also possible to tag elements and provide a color.
This implementation was inspired by https://github.com/fathzer/javaluator[Javaluator].
The dice evaluator works on lists, summing the rolls together is optional.

=== Goals

* Always get the dice rolls in the answer, even for complex expressions
* Clear defined operator precedence and correct bracket handling
* Support for custom dice sides with text or symbols instant of numbers
* Don’t always give the sum of the dice as answer but working with lists
* Operators can handle, when possible and intuitive, lists of elements/numbers
* Custom exception for errors in the expression evaluation
* Usage of as few symbols as possible
* No infinity loops possible and configurable limits for expensive operations
* Make testing easy be providing the options to provide a custom, non-random, number generator

=== Development Decisions

* It should be possible to get the resul of each die (for e.g. pool systems) and to add the dice results together.
Therefor the default must be only append elements together and a special operator `=` must be used to sum the elements.
* Exception over unintuitive behavior -> It is better that the user knows what is not working then that something is working, but they don’t know what and why
* not every operator can handel lists -> to many operators are not intuitive:
** is max on list the count or the sum of the elements
** how to multiply and divide lists

== Usage

The evaluator processes dice expression and returns a list of rolls, each containing a list of elements.
Elements have a value (a number or a text) and can have a color.
For example `2d6` rolls two six-sided dice and returns a list with two elements, each with a value between 1 and 6. To get the sum of the roll, simple add a `=` at the end, for example in this case `2d6=`.
The same applies to numbers `3 + 5` has as result a list with the elements 3 and 5, only if written as `3 + 5=` the result is 8.
All non-functional text must be surrounded (escaped) by `'`. For example `1d('head' + 'tail')` will flip a coin.
List can be included into the expression by using square brackets.
An empty list `[]` or empty literal `''` are non value.
For example `1d[2,2,4,4,6,6]` will a die which has two sides with 2, two sides with 4 and two sides with 6. The roll will be a list with one element, which has a value of 2, 4 or 6. Lists also escape characters, so `1d[head,tail]` will also flip a coin.

Multiple expression can be separated by `,`.
For example `3d6, 4d8` will roll two six-sided dice and return a list with two rolls, the first one containing the roll elements of the `3d6` and the second one the roll of the `4d8`.

Operators have a precedent, which is defined by the order of the operators in the table below.
Operators with a higher precedence are evaluated first.
Brackets can be used to change the order of evaluation.
For example `1d4+3d6` is the appending of roll of 1d4 and 3d6, but `(1d4+3=)d6)` gets first the sum of the roll of 1d4 and 3 and then rolls this number of d6.

The number of dice is limited to 1000 and every number approve 9 digits or with more than 9 digit after the decimal dot result in an error.

Boolean values will be represented by `'true'` (or `1`) and `'false'` (or `0`) .

It is possible to set tags and color.
Colors have no direct effect and will be also set to all random elements of the expression.
Tags on the other hand wil change the interaction of with other operators, in most cases operators will work only on elements with the same tag.

=== Operators

All operators are case insensitiv.

=== Functions

All functions are case insensitiv.

[width="100%",cols="6%,22%,14%,58%",options="header",]
|===
|Name |Notation |Example |Description
|min |`min(<expression1>, <expression2> ...)` |`min(4d6)` |returns the smallest elements (multiple if the smallest is not unique) of one or more inner expressions. Text is compared alphabetically
|max |`max(<expression1>, <expression2> ...)` |`max(4d6)` |returns the largest elements (multiple if the largest is not unique) of one or more inner expressions. Text is compared alphabetically
|sort asc |`asc(<expression1>, <expression2> ...)` |`asc(4d6)` |sorts all elements ascending of one or more inner expressions. Text is compared alphabetically
|sort desc |`desc(<expression1>, <expression2> ...)` |`desc(4d6)` |sorts all elements descending of one or more inner expressions. Text is compared alphabetically
|cancel |`cancel(<expression>, <listA>, <listB>)` |`cancel(8d10, 10, 1)` |the elements of listA and listB (can also be single elements) cancel each other and remove each other from the result.
|replace |`replace(<expression>, <find>, <replace> ...)` |`replace(8d10, [9/10], 'bonus')` | each element in `<expression>` that matches on of the elements in `<find>` will be replaced with the elements in `<replace>`. `<replace>` can be an empty list `[]` or literal `''` and thereby removing the found elements. It is possible to add multiple <find>/<replace> pairs to replace different elements in one replace. If the <replace> expression contains dice then they will only be rolled on a matching find element and for each matching element again.
|explode |`exp(<roll>,<rerollOnList>,<numberOfRerolls>` |`exp(d[1/2/3],[2/3])` or `exp(d[1/2/3],[2/3], 2)` | Rerolls the `<roll>` expression if any of its result elements are in the elements of `<rerollOnList>` and returns the original result  and all reroll results. If `<roll>` contain more then one die then all are rerolled, even if only on result of one die matches the reroll list. `<numberOfRerolls>` define the maximum number of rerolls bevor the function stops with rerolls and returns the current result. `<numberOfRerolls>` must be a number between 0 and 100. If `<numberOfRerolls>` is not provided as argument then 100 will be used.
|if |`if(<boolean>,<true>,<false>)` |`if(1d6=?6,'six','not six')` or `if(1d6=?6,'six')` or `val('$r',1d6), if('$r'=?1,'one','$r'=?2,'two','else') |if `<boolean>` equal true then return the `<true>` expression or else the `<false>` expression. The `<false>` expression is optional, if it is missing and `<boolean>` is `false` then the result empty. It is possible to add more than `<boolean>,<true>` pair in the function, the result will be the `<true>` of the first true `<boolean>`, coming from left. All <boolean> must be non-empty and contain only on element (therefor can't contain only `val`). `val` are will only set in the first <true>. Use the following structure to use `if` to set different value in a `val`: `if(1d6>?4, val('$a',10), val('$a',-10))`, this will set '$a' to 10 if the 1d6 roll is bigger than 4 and to -10 otherwise.
|group count |`groupC(<expression1>, <expression2> ...)` |`groupC(20d6)` | counts all elements of with the same value and provides the results as list in the format of `<count>x<value>`
|concatenate  |`concat(<expression1>, <expression2> ...)` |`concat('Attack: ', 2d20, ' Damage:', 3d6+5=)` | Joining all expressions together to a single result.
|value |`val(<valueName>, <value>)` |`val('$1',6d6), '$1'=, ('$1'>4)c` | Defining a value (that get evaluated once) that can be used in multiple times in the same expression. The value name must be surrounded by two `'`. Every occurrence of the valueName will be replaced by the value, with the expeption of `<valueName>` and it is possible to overwrite a value name. For example `val('$1',6d6), '$1'=, ('$1'>4)c` would define the result of `6d6` as `'$1'`. Therefore, `'$1'=` would provide the sum and `('$1'>4)c` the count of dice with a value greater than 4 of the same dice throw.
